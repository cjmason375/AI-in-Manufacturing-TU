### Details about BrickML

> "***BrickML*** is a low-power high-performance self-contained embedded device designed to run machine learning operations at the edge in industry settings." ~ [Reloc](https://www.reloc.it/download/products/RD-BML/R22P04P1XDT00_BrickML-Box_UserManual_r11.pdf)

The BrickML module is designed to be mounted directly onto equipment for environmental, sound, and motion-related Machine Learning (ML) data collection. With on-board computing, sensing, and communication capabilities, the BrickML is also resistant to rugged use (dust and moisture resistant). Direct interfacing with Edge Impulse ML software allows for more speed and less development time while also allowing users a flexible suite for custom development.
